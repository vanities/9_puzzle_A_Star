# 9_puzzle_A_Star
A* search algorithm implemented to solve the 9 puzzle problem


We used 4 different heuristics for A*, the first being Uniform Cost Search, then displaced tiles, next Manhattan distance. 

The forth is a custom heuristic, I used Euclidean distance. It's performance was somewhere between displaced and Manhattan. The reason was because our 9 tile puzzle could only go in the 4 cardinal directions.
